--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2013.08.30 V0100

Original version is released.
This version is based on flow-speed/dispersive version named "JAGURS_with_DISP_V0120".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2013.09.26 V0110

  run-time parameter file as 'start_date="2013-09-26 00:00:00"'.
  Any string within 64 characters can be specified to 'start_date' and
  the default value is '2000-01-01 00:00:00'.
  This value is put int the 'units' attribute of 'time' record.
  Like, 'seconds since [start_date]'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2013.10.01 V0111

Default value of max_step and conv_val has been changed.

Max. elapsed time can be specified on run-time parameter file as
'max_time="24:00:00"', 'max_time="30:00"', or 'max_time="3600"'.

  only on root domain.

- Support negative max height.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2014.01.16 V0171

- Multi-members on a job is supported.
  Specify "MULTI=ON" in Makefile.* and make it. Run jagurs like...

   $ mpirun -np 400 ./jagurs 1-100 tsun.par

  In this case, 100 members run on a job with 400 processes
  (4 processes for each member).
  Input files should be in "input.[member ID (6 digits)]" and output files are put into

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2015.02.23 V0321

2015.07.16 V0328

NOTE: PROJ.4 library (URL: https://trac.osgeo.org/proj/) is necessary.

- The following functions about initial displacement become available.

   - Initial displacement is given by fault calculation if "init_disp_fault=1"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2015.08.03 V0330

- The name of the parameter "apply_filter" is changed into "apply_kj_filter".

- If there exist the grid points in which distance to the source is zero,
  the source is displaced +1.0d-6 [m] to x direction.
  This prevents zero-division in subroutine SRECTG (okada.sub.f).

- Coordinate conversions about the grid points in which distance to the source is
  > 30.0d0 [degree] are skipped.
  This prevents invalid operation on broad area calc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017.07.12 V0406

- When extremely numerous initial displacements are specified with NCDIO,
one entry can exceed 4 GByte. So, default format is changed into NetCDF4.

NOTE: Use "ncdmerge.V0182" in case "NCDIO" for this version!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017.07.18 V0407

  Specify "broken_rate=[real number]" in "tsun.par".
  Then, the height of sea wall becomes [real number]-times when the first overflow occurs.

- Minimum wave height on each grid point during the simulation is output
  when HZMINOUT=ON is specified in Makefile. Use ncdmerge.V0200 or later.

  are applied (contributed by N.Yamamoto @ NIED. Thanks!).
  - Initial displacement file becomes available.
  - Amplitude (h0) can be specified on polar coordination case, too.

- In default, elastic loading is calculated only on the root domain and ones on
  child domains are given by interpolation.
  In default, 3rd order spline interpolation is utilized.
  If "use_linear=1" is specified in "tsun.par", linear interpolation is utilized.
  If "elastic_loading_interpolation=0" is specified in "tsun.par", elastic loading
  is calculated on each domain.

- On flux calculation, the argument of sqrt on limiter operations can sometimes
  be negative. To prevent this, 

     d = half*(dz(i+1,j)+dz(i,j)+hz_old(i+1,j)+hz_old(i,j))
     d = half*(dz(i,j+1)+dz(i,j)+hz_old(i,j+1)+hz_old(i,j))
